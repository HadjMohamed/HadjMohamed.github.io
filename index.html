                    <span>ENSTA Paris</span>
                    <p>I hold a Master of Science (French <em>dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur</em>) focused on IT development for complex systems.</p>
                    <p>This degree equipped me with a solid foundation in software engineering, applied to practical challenges mainly in Python, C and C++. On top of that, the aim of this MSc was not just to learn how to code, but to gain a physical and logical understanding of systems, enabling smart and efficient work by anticipating user expectations and meeting them effectively.</p>
                    <p>Graduated with 3.96 GPA.</p>

                    <h3>2 years of experience</h3>
                    <span>ArianeGroup</span>
                    <p>While building a strong educational foundation, my engineering studies were structured around an apprenticeship program, alternating between academic periods at school and hands-on experience in a company: ArianeGroup. I began my career as a flight safety engineer, where my technical skills quickly led to a transition into a software developer role at the European leader in space launchers.</p>

                    <h3>Explosion consequences prevision tool</h3>
                    <p>For safety flight department, I self-developed backend and user interface of a software able to predict explosions consequences. 
                        <p>The backend involved collecting experimental data from curves, processing the data by filtering out irrelevant points, and loading it into a database.</p>
                        <p>Through an OOP Python-based UI integrated with a database, the tool automatically generated reports based on user inputs.</p>
                        <p>This project was particularly challenging due to working within a secured Python environment. However, collaborating with senior developers enhanced my comfort with data manipulation and efficient programming practices.</p>
                        <p>The tool was successfully adopted by the company, boosting the safety department's productivity by <strong>60%</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Chatbot based on personal data</h3>
                    <p>When I first created this website, I felt something was missing: <strong>hIAdj</strong>. Beyond being proud of its name, this chatbot introduced me to text retrieval techniques such as cosine similarity, vector databases, and MMR.</p>

                    <p>Rather than relying on an existing AI via API prompting, I was determined to build my own text generation solution‚Äîand that's exactly what I did!</p>
                    
                    <p>While <strong>hIAdj</strong> may not be as efficient as an OpenAI model due to my limited resources, I focused on implementing a simple yet effective approach to answer questions without depending on publicly available BERT models.</p>

                    <p>As the Chief Operations Officer at Clothy, I led the development and deployment of an innovative app allowing users to order clothing with delivery in under 30 minutes. Our API seamlessly integrates with fashion e-commerce platforms, providing a smooth and fast shopping experience.</p>
                    <p>My role involved overseeing daily operations, coordinating technical and logistics teams, and ensuring customer satisfaction. I also optimized delivery routes, leveraging eco-friendly transportation methods such as bikes and electric scooters to minimize our carbon footprint.</p>
