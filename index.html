                    <span>ENSTA Paris</span>
                    <p>I hold a Master of Science (French <em>diplôme d'ingénieur</em>) focused on IT development for complex systems.</p>
                    <p>This degree equipped me with a solid foundation in software engineering, applied to practical challenges mainly in Python, C and C++. On top of that, the aim of this MSc was not just to learn how to code, but to gain a physical and logical understanding of systems, enabling smart and efficient work by anticipating user expectations and meeting them effectively.</p>
                    <p>Graduated with 3.96 GPA.</p>

                    <span>ArianeGroup</span>
                    <p>While building a strong educational foundation, my engineering studies were structured around an apprenticeship program, alternating between academic periods at school and hands-on experience in a company: ArianeGroup. I began my career as a flight safety engineer, where my technical skills quickly led to a transition into a software developer role at the European leader in space launchers.</p>

                    <h3>Explosion consequences prevision tool</h3>
                    <p>My mission was to create a tool that could automatically generate reports based on user inputs, significantly reducing the time spent on manual data entry and report generation.</p>
                    <p>I developed a solution using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract data from a 600-page physical workbook, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. To clean and structure the data, I implemented an ETL pipeline orchestrated with Airflow, using Pandas for preprocessing.
                    </p>
                    <p>All development was done under the supervision of four senior developers, following a robust CI/CD workflow. I automated the generation of reports and containerized the entire tool with Docker to ensure portability and reproducibility.</p>
                        <p>The tool was successfully adopted by the company, boosting the safety department's productivity by <strong>60%</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Chatbot based on personal data</h3>
                    <p>When I first created this website, I felt something was missing: <strong>hIAdj</strong>. Beyond being proud of its name, this chatbot introduced me to text retrieval techniques and ML engineering.</p> 
                    <p>Curious to see what a local chatbot could do with my own data, I built a lightweight RAG pipeline from scratch.</p> 
                    <p>It retrieves the most relevant content from a ChromaDB vector database and feeds it to an open-source LLM (DeepSeek V3) to generate responses. If no useful document is found, it falls back to a custom prompt-only mode based on a pre-defined FAQ.</p> 
                    <p>The whole system runs on a FastAPI backend, fully containerized with Docker and ready to deploy. A Makefile simplifies both local runs and cloud deployment—Terraform integration is on the roadmap.</p> 
                    <p>While <strong>hIAdj</strong> may not match the efficiency of OpenAI models due to my limited resources, I focused on building a simple yet effective solution that puts my entire data engineering stack into action.</p>

                    <p>Born from a two-week challenge, the <strong>Reddit Fake News Detector</strong> is a data-driven tool designed to classify news headlines from Reddit’s <code>r/worldnews</code> as real or fake using NLP and machine learning.</p> 
                    <p>We built a full pipeline—from scraping headlines with the Reddit API to storing them in BigQuery, analyzing them with a fine-tuned BERT model, and displaying results through an interactive Streamlit app. Everything runs on a Python backend orchestrated with Airflow and exposed via FastAPI.</p> 
                    <p>Updates were scheduled every 24 hours (no longer updated because of hosting costs), ensuring fresh data and live classification results. The goal? Help users visualize how content is classified and better understand the patterns behind online misinformation.</p>
